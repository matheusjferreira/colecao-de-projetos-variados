> # Spacex Quiz

> ## The Project:

Quiz done in C language about the company Spacex for the activity of English V, from the course of Analysis and Systems Development at the Technology College of Americana - SP (FATEC).
It is a program that forces the user to a menu with the option to start the quiz, see the answers, copyright and the option to end the program. As the user answers the quiz a file ".bin" (binary) with the name "answers.bin" is created and all the user's answers are written in it, so that when the user accesses through the menu the option of answers, the program opens and reads the data that were recorded during the quiz.
