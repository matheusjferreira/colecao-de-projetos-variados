> ## O Projeto:

Codigo desenvolvido por Omar Khaled em 11/11/2019, estudado e alterado por Matheus Jediel Ferreira e Bruno Silva Rodrigues para a confecção de artigos científicos com temas no método simplex durante a matéria de "Programação Linear" do terceiro semestre de Análise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas da FATEC - Americasa SP.

Example: A toy manufacturing organization manufactures two types of toys A and B. Both the toys are sold at Rs.25 and Rs.20 respectively. There are 2000 resource units available every day from which the toy A requires 20 units while toy B requires 12 units. Both of these toys require a production time of 5 minutes. Total working hours are 9 hours a day. What should be the manufacturing quantity for each of the pipes to maximize the profits?

	The objective function is:
	Max.Z=25x+20y

	where x are the units of pipe A

	y are the units of pipe B

	Constraints:
	20x+12y<=2000

	5x+5y<=540
